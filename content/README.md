This folder is ignored by git but is used to store customer-supplied assets,
such as images. These will be transformed as needed by the build system and
placed into `build/content`. Thumbnails will also be generated, into
`build/content/thumbs`.

In additon, a special page will be generated: `[root]/__content.html`,
containing a list of all customer-supplied images.
